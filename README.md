### trove4j
Fork of trove4j (https://bitbucket.org/trove4j/trove) used in IntelliJ IDEA. This project is obsolete and isn't maintained 
anymore, it is used mainly for compatibility with old plugins for IntelliJ IDEA which use classes from this library.

IntelliJ platform was migrated to use [fastutil](https://fastutil.di.unimi.it/) library.
